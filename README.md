# The BeerZerker
## You are the ‘BeerZerker’; a local resident of the town, Darlstream. 

<br />

### In this 2D adventure, you must navigate the town and the challenges it presents with a simple goal in mind, get drunk and get bloody. As the ‘BeerZerker’, you will need to satisfy your need to drink and kill, but being out of money you’ll have to decide how you go about getting the beer.
### Take things slow and exercise some restraint by working an honest day's work to earn some coin for your beer. However, if that isn't your style then wait for nightfall and tread lightly as you sneak around the guards trying to get that sweet beer.
### Kindly deeds and clean weapons not your style either? Well then get ready for a brawl, being sober, you won’t be at your best but you can still try some brute force if you fancy.

<br />

## The goal is to drink all the beer in the area, once you have done this by the means you desire you can move on to the next area and start again.
